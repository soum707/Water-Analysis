# Tap Water Quality Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **Tap Water Quality Analysis Dashboard**, a simple yet powerful app designed to help you understand the quality of your tap water. This dashboard makes water data easy to read, visualize, and analyze. Whether you're curious about the mineral content in your water or want to check if everything is within safe limits, this app has you covered!

## What It Does

- Displays water quality data in an easy-to-read format.
- Highlights important statistics like averages and trends.
- Provides visual insights with charts for quick understanding.
- Flags potential health risks when parameters exceed safe thresholds.

## How It Works

The dashboard runs on **Streamlit** and processes data from a CSV file. First, the raw data is cleaned and converted into a user-friendly format (don’t worry about units like `ppm` or `ppb`—we’ve got it covered). Once the data is ready, the app brings it to life with interactive tables, charts, and health alerts.
